Smash Cipher
------------

A set of tools to demonstrate various attacks on cryptography. Currently utilizes the
Cryptography and primefac libraries to allow easy generation of private keys from
vulnerable public keys. Overall attempts to demonstrate attacks in a way that a
novice, with minor knowledge of OpenSSL could carry them out and understand
them.

Current Developments
====================

To make the library more tolerant to time and allow it to incorperate more recent development,
the primefac library needs to be upgraded to Python 3. It is currently undecided whether it would
be better to attempt to update the library or to start a new one from scratch.
